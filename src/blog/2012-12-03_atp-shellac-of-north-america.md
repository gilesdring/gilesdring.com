  Just on the train on the way home from another great

  Well, great from the perspective of bands at any rate. The venue (Pontins at
  Camber Sands) took a bit of adjustment after the relative luxury of previous
  years — a severely limited choice of food and a bordering-on-the-suicidal
  bar management policy (running out of three of the four frankly below-par
  draught beers mid-way through the second day, and chronic understaffing the
  bars) being the most obvious areas of want. Then there was the frankly
  baffling security policy — randomly closing exits for no apparent reason,
  very rigid application of apparently arbitrary traffic control — very rum.
</p>

<p>
  However, rant over, there were some excellent bands on offer — with no real
  duffers, but here are my highlights...
</p><!-- more -->

<h2>Day one</h2>

<p>
  The event being curated by <em>Shellac</em> (billed as <em>Shellac of North
  America</em>, presumably to differentiate them from all the other Shellacs
  in circulation) this was always going to be a noisy line up, and Bristol's
  <a href="http://myownflag.bandcamp.com/" title="link to MyOwnFlag on Bandcamp">MyOwnFlag</a>
  were the first to fulfil the promise. Good, honest, angular math rock!
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrawl" title="link to Scrawl on Wikipedia">Scrawl</a>
  gave an awesome performance of proto-Riot Grrrl indie (&copy; lazy comparisons
  'r' us). They were also the most prominent band in the audiences at the
  festival — everywhere I turned, I ran across the drummer. I even bumped into
  them at the station waiting for the train on they way home.
</p>

<p>
  The final highlight of day one was the set by
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Turing-Machine/225159867528633"
     title="link to Turing Machine Facebook page">Turing Machine</a>. Great
  loping grooves and Hawkwind-y motorik stuff going on, with a few nods
  to the funkier elements of post-punk. Other points of reference:
  <em>!!!</em>, an altogether noisier <em>Hot Chip</em> (geeks with grooves)
  and <em>LCD Soundsystem</em> (whose Nancy Whang joined them for the finale).
</p>

<h2>Day two</h2>

<p>
  Day two brought a further series of delights, starting with
  <a href="http://www.bukeandgase.com/" title="link to Buke and Gase's website">Buke and Gase</a>
  wielding their wonderful series of musical contraptions to superb effect.
  Coming on like a cross between <em>Throwing Muses</em>, <em>Grizzly Bear</em>,
  <em>Kate Bush</em> and <em>Rodrigo y Gabriela</em> on acid, they were one of
  the highlights of the festival. I'd recommend a listen to the recent EP
  <em>Function Falls</em> and 2010's <em>Riposte</em> (standout track
  <em>Revel in Contempt</em>).
</p>

<p>
  An unfortunate scheduling clash meant I wasn't able to see the majority of
  what was promising to be a great set by
  <a href="http://www.pinkflag.com/" title="link to the Wire website">Wire</a>
  — the sonic assault of
  <a href="http://www.melt-banana.net/" title="link to the Melt-Banana website">Melt Banana</a>
  was calling. They didn't dissappont, and the crowd reacted with a volatile
  mosh pit and more crowd surfing than I've seen in a long time. They even
  chucked in a cover of “Wonderful World” for good measure. Awesome. This was
  given a run for its money by
  <a href="http://zenigeva.jpn.org/" title="link to Zeni Geva website">Zeni Geva</a>'s
  set, which delivered on the promise of the “prog hardcore metal” label.
  Even better, however, was
  <a href="http://kknull.com/en/" title="link to KK Null website">KK Null</a>'s
  solo set which unleashed 15 minutes of relentless aural assault.
</p>

<h2>Day three</h2>

<p>
  The third day delivered delights in the form of
  <a href="http://www.thecravats.com/" title="link to The Cravats website">The Cravats</a>'
  skronky para-punk (and best song introduction of the festival:
  "This song is called <em>I Hate The Universe</em>, which pretty much covers
  everything"), and
  <a href="http://www.themembranes.co.uk/" title="link to The Membranes website">The Membranes</a>'
  bombast.
  <a href="http://www.theex.nl/" title="link to The Ex website">The Ex</a> also
  impressed, although it did look like they were being menaced by the brass
  section at times. Then there was the psychedeilic rock of
  <a href="http://uk.myspace.com/alixband" title="link to the ALiX myspace">Alix</a>,
  the best of a number of Italian bands on the bill.
</p>

<p>
  Sunday, however, was all about
  <a href="http://deadrider.us/" title="link to the Dead Rider website">Dead Rider</a>
  and <a href="http://uk.myspace.com/alixband" title="link to Shellac's myspace">Shellac</a>.
  The <a href="http://deadrider.us/" title="link to the Dead Rider website">former</a>
  lived up to my expectations — brilliantly unhinged live, and one of the few
  bands I've seen who seem to manage to translate this to their recordings
  (2010's <em>The Raw Dents</em> being exactly what I was hoping it would be).
  Really great chunky, vision-disrupting sub-bass and angular guitar and
  rhythms combined with a brilliant display of showmanship (verbally abusing
  the drummer during the drum solo, the virtuosic catch and subsequent seamless
  donning of an unexpected woolen hat thrown from the crowd) to produce far
  and away the most entertaining set of the weekend.
</p>

<p>
  And finally to the headliners.
  <a href="http://uk.myspace.com/alixband" title="link to Shellac's myspace">Shellac</a>'s
  set was as intense, powerful and accomplished as one has come to expect —
  they've lost none of their drive in their twenty year career. What sets them
  apart from the "me too" acts is the biting humour and intelligence exhibited
  by the band. This was a set for the mind as well as the body. The mid-set
  Q&amp;A incorporated a grammar lesson, and Steve's impassioned plea to make
  the bands part of our lives underlined their utter commitment to talent.
  The closing act of Steve and Bob dismantling Todd's kit as he continued
  to play was a joy to behold. Inspiring.
