I've been using the [Craft Design Technology Energel Tradio Pen](https://www.thejournalshop.com/craft-design-technology-energel-tradio-pen-black) as my main writing implement for a while. It's got a very smooth action, and (when I'm concentrating) it helps me actually make legible notes. I'm blogging about it cause I'm likely to need to order it again, and I'd forgotten where I got it.

I've also really liked the form of the [Mnemosyne Double Perforated Notepad](https://www.thejournalshop.com/mnemosyne-double-perforated-notepad-n177).
