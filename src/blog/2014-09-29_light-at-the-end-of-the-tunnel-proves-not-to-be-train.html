  I've been spectacularly poor at blogging since committing to do so. This
  tells me I must make it part of a routine - perhaps with morning coffee.

  This may become easier as I claimed a small victory this evening by
  completing a thorny chunk of proof of concept code. It's definitely
  not the best UX possible but it's all working under the covers. This
  feature made heavy use of Angular directives, which have been bending
  my head somewhat. I think a blog post may be in order to try to
  consolidate my understanding of this topic.

<p>Onwards and upwards!</p>
