Another day, another post. Nothing really to
say: I'm just trying to form a habit.

A few observations from the day:

* My commute was accompanied by three
  excellent podcasts:
  [99 Percent Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mini-stories-volume-1/),
  [In Our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b085xpzf) and
  [The Bugle](http://thebuglepodcast.com).
  In particular, the Kepler IOT was
  fascinating. Must read more about him.<!-- more -->
* When working on intangible capability
  delivery, user stories are not a great
  vehicle. Something like capability
  statements (e.g. We can create a new
  Virtual Machine from an OVF using PowerCLI)
  feels more meaningful. It's a way of
  placing acceptance criteria at the forefront
  of developers minds. It's also a very
  powerful means of explaining intangible
  stuff to non-technical people. May also
  help with testing.
* I must get better at turning down meetings,
  or making priority calls. Two hours in my
  life I won't get back!
* Had a good meeting with a key stakeholder.
  He is in some opposition to another key
  stakeholder and it feels like I should
  align myself to the one I met today.

More on all of this later.
