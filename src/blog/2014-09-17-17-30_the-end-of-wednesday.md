Today turned out to be a very productive day, although not quite as
anticipated.

My plan was to create an architecture overview for the proof of
concept, and following a brief interrupt to attend another call, I began
reviewing the available documentation.<!-- more --> I'd sketched an overview on the
whiteboard yesterday, so had an idea of direction of travel. On the basis that I
have two weeks to create something working (and am architect, business analyst
and coder on this project!), I decided to dive into some code from an earlier
demo.

This proved useful, as by the end of the day I had a working framework. It doesn't do anything yet, but I feel like I've created some useful foundations. I've also started to document the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog">product backlog</a>, which I'll focus on more tomorrow. In classic to-do list style, I wrote my first backlog item -- "Working static site integrating existing styles and templates" -- and 10 minutes later crossed it off, having achieved it. An immediate sensation of progress ensued.

I also reaquainted myself with <code>git</code>, as I find managing code in a  structured way helps with my forward momentum, as well as ensuring that I occasionally create an offsite working copy of my development. It may also enable me to collaborate with others, if I can find anyone!

Finally, I used my favourite strategy for concentrating in an open office: music. My concentration music of choice is Glenn Gould's 1955 recording of <em>The Goldberg Variations</em>, followed by Brian Eno's <em>Music for Airports</em>. The Bach is particularly good for typing, as I think my fingers try to keep up with the music.
