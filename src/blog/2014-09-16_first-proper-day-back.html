<p>Having survived the first day and got my bearings again, I'm about to embark
  on the first day back in the office.

  The commute was OK, made more bearable by
  resuming my diet of podcasts. Today's listening included the
  <a target="_blank" href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/genesis-object/">current episode of 99 Percent Invisible</a>
  (essential listening) and a
  <a target="_blank" href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/178">rather more ancient episode of Back to Work</a>.
  99 Percent Invisible always gives great food for thought, and today's serving
  posed questions about the role and process of Design, and attempting to second
  guess motivation from the end result.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the day ahead, I have a few processes to rediscover, and a
  degree of reintegrating myself with the office environment. First step: coffee,
  followed by a peek at the calendar and emails that arrived overnight. These
  tend to be automated, and may require me to prod buttons in our various systems to progress HR-type processes. Ah, the joys of being a manager.</p>
