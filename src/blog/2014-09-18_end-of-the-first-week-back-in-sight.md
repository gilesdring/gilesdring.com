"Hang on Giles, it is but Thursday. You've got a whole two days left!"
Gentle reader, I am one of those fortunate few who have forgone salary for a
reduced working week, and as a result, Thursday is the new Friday as far as I
am concerned. I've decided to celebrate by working at home, to further progress
the thinking on the Proof of Concept.

<!-- more -->

The day in prospect is relatively clear at present. I have a brief review of a
colleague's document and estimates to complete and subsequent related
discussion. I have a couple of internal European / Global organisation
meetings (which I may treat as optional, given other pressures). Other than
that, the day will be spent thinking and documenting.

I've decided to use our internal social collaboration tool (wiki, forum,
activity tracking) to manage the information, as I don't have time for the
overhead of managing a document set in _traditional office tools_.
My first task will be to rough out and create the appropriate (minimal)
structure and then to begin populating it.
