So a few metrics:

Passwords changed: 6 (8 if you include the one I had to reset twice)

Software updates applied: 160+ (granted, this was a background task)

Emails:
<!-- more -->
<ul>
  <li>received during sabbatical: 1599</li>
  <li>deleted outright with cursory scan (sender / subject line): approx 550</li>
  <li>requiring immediate action: 1</li>
  <li>of immediate relevance to current / future work: 5-10</li>
  <li>remaining in backlog: 176 (the balance were filed for reference, or had minimum action performed e.g. brief response sent)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
  </li>
  <li>Projects on the horizon, more to be found out about tomorrow
    <ul>
      <li>A paper-based feasibility study: writing / completing a document</li>
      <li>A proof of concept</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Meetings set up for tomorrow:
    <ul>
      <li>1 (one) on-account solution review: this is a process that can take up a fair chunk of time in a working week</li>
      <li>1 (one) off account technical / delivery assessment preparatory meeting: hour long preparation for a review (Potential time suck!)</li>
      <li>1 (one) face-to-face with a customer team that I work with: good opportunity to catch up with them, and reacquaint myself with the technical (and political) landscape</li>
      <li>1 (one) teleconference aimed at all people managers in my organisation: opportunity to find out what's going on internally</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Meetings not set up, but required:
    <ul>
      <li>Further conversations with direct reports (some of whom work on the site I'll be at tomorrow), peers and (hopefully) my manager</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That actually turned out to be a really useful reflection, especially on the ratio of ham to spam in emails, and the purposes behind meetings.</p>

<p>I've also turned on spell checking in my browser, so that I remeber (sic) to spell things correctly when blogging.</p>
