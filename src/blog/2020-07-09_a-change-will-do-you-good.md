Second run of Sofa To So Far, and this time I was accompanied by Gang of Four.
More mid-tempo stuff, but with some aggression this time. I reckon I need to put
together a running punk playlist.<!-- more -->

Sore quads from Tuesday's run, but managed to run for the first 10 mimutes with few problems.
I worked quite hard on 'easy running', having had a chat with Jimmy about this.
I've a definite tendency to head off too fast (cycling too), so this is really going back to school.
The second half of the run comprised 2 minute fast followed by 2 minute slow intervals.
I'd been advised to just move my legs faster rather than lengthening my stride.
I found myself thinking about how when I first got into road cycling, I had to learn to cycle at a high
cadence and let the gears to the work.
This felt quite similar.
On the evidence of today --- slow pace indistinguishable from fast pace --- I'll need to learn similar
lessons related to running.

Another rest day tomorrow.
