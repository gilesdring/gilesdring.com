Final run of week one - it was optional, so I didn't feel too bad having a 5 minute sit down in the
middle! Felt really good for the first 5 or mins, like I was in a real flow. I think the fluency
and stamina will come as I run more (and the weight comes off). I again justified the periods of walking by ensuring I keep enjoying
running.<!-- more -->

The tunes today came from White Denim. Great driving rhythms. It's one of their best albums for a while, and
all recorded on lockdown. They're still one of the best live acts I've ever seen, or are ever likely to see.
I just grinned for the whole set.
