I've made some New Year's resolutions

<!-- more -->

* _Blog more_  
  I've periodically found blogging a great way of building reflection into
  my working practices. I resolve to do more of it.
* _Do it now!_  
  As one of the world's great procrastinators, I resolve to act more urgently.
  I've made a good start by starting to get my financial planning sorted out.
  (NB This almost made it to the resolution list in it's own right.)
* _Practice guitar more_  
  I have started playing with a bunch of friends every other Friday night.
  I'm now acutely aware that I can fall back to tried and tested riffs.
  I resolve to improve my playing.

There are other things that I want to ensure I prioritise, but won't make
specific resolutions about them. Three feels like enough. For my reference,
more than anything else, they are:

* Prepare fresh food with the kids (for me too!)
* Build the local small/medium business support work, which I find massively
  rewarding.
* Check social media much less
* Get to bed earlier (ironically, I'm writing this at 11:13 PM)
