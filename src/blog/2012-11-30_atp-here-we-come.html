  Just getting ready to set off to <a href="http://www.atpfestival.com/events/shellacxmas.php" title="ATP website for the festival">ATP</a> at Camber Sands. It’s going to be a great weekend! As a service to my fellow revellers, I’ve dropped the running order into a <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/27lkeg11bnlminsonb1kcc3ij0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics" title="Link to calendar with line up">calendar</a> you can subscribe to on your phone (or whatever).
</p>
<p>Just <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/27lkeg11bnlminsonb1kcc3ij0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics" title="Link to calendar with line up">click here</a> and see what happens…</p>

<p>EDIT: hmmm. Doesn’t seem to be working in all cases…
Try <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=27lkeg11bnlminsonb1kcc3ij0%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/London">this link</a> instead… Sorry!</p>

<p>EDIT II: So on an iPhone, press and hold <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/27lkeg11bnlminsonb1kcc3ij0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics" title="Link to calendar with line up">this link</a> and select the “Copy” option. Then open the iPhone settings app, scroll down to “Mail, Contacts, Calendar”, select “Add Account…”, “Other”, “Add Subscribed Calendar”. Press and hold in the “Server” box to paste in the link and it <em>should</em> work!</p>
