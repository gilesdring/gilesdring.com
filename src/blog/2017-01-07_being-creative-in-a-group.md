I've been playing in a band with some local friends / dads (prosaically known until yesterday as _Dad Band_, now dubbed _Fustians_). Every other Friday night we book out a rehearsal studio and bash out a few tunes. We've been doing it for six months or so, and having made a decision not to do covers, it's been interesting to observe the growth of a creative unit.

On reflection, we've been traversing the stages of group development as [described by Bruce Tuckman][TUCKMAN].

Our early practices were filled with optimism and some early success in the form of some pretty musically interesting jams. We've even developed a few nascent songs.
I'd classify that as __forming__. 
It feels as though we've moved into a __storming__ period where minor difficulties and differences are causing wobbles in the initial optimism.
Tuckman tells us this is a natural part of moving into the __norming__ stage where the group roles and agreements are made.
This paves the way for the __performing__ stage when we begin operating as a well-oiled machine.

I suspect that this may be a slightly uncomfortable period for the group, especially given it's essentially mates getting together for a fun evening. It's also worth remembering that it's a cycle that is likely to repeat if we ever decide to go gigging or record tunes properly.

Another observation is that as a group we're creating, which has a descriptive models of its own. This brings additional tensions. Models that seem to ring true are the [four][4SC] or (marginally extended) [five stage][5SC] models.

The five stages are:

1. Preparation - learning chops, absorbing ideas
2. Incubation - jamming, practicing, mulling over ideas
3. Insight - having an idea for a melody, chord sequence, lyric
4. Evaluation - assessing the idea for value, sharing with the band
5. Elaboration - working hard to develop the idea and polish it to a finished product. This is the bit where most of the 99% perspiration resides.

As this last bit is hard graft, it's also trying given the group dynamic development.
