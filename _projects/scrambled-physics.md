I've written a simple physics library in [Processing](http://processing.org).
It's called ScrambledPhysics, and you can
[get it on github](http://gilesdring.github.io/scrambledphysics).

<canvas style="image-rendering: optimizequality ! important;" height="480" width="640" tabindex="0" id="ScrambledPhysics" data-processing-sources="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilesdring/scrambledphysics/master/ScrambledPhysics.pde /s/Example.pde">
  <p>Your browser does not support the canvas tag.</p>
  <!-- Note: you can put any alternative content here. -->
</canvas>

This demo is based on two files:

* [Example.pde](/s/Example.pde)
* [ScrambledPhysics.pde](/s/ScrambledPhysics.pde)
