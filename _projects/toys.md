From time to time I create something useful for a specific purpose.
These often find repeated use, and I'm sharing them here in case they are of
interest to you. I call these toys, in reference to the
[Birmingham toy trade][TOYS]
of the 18th Century.

## Automated Compact Calendar

I came across the [Compact Calendar][CC] by David Seah a few years ago, and
found it to be a hugely useful tool for planning. David had published an
Excel version of the calendar, along with the nicely designed PDF versions:
I just added a few tweaks to this to work the way my
brain does. He's continued to develop it, and now has similar functionality,
and I recommend you take a look at this as well. In fact, David has a heap of
useful tools which help track and manage time, some of which I return to from
time-to-time. Do take a look at his site.

In the meantime, here's my [Automated Compact Calendar][ACC] tool as an Excel
template.
