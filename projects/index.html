<p>I'm starting to collect and publish the <a href="https://gilesdring.squarespace.com/projects">personal projects</a> that I'm working on or have completed. These range in size from <a href="https://gilesdring.squarespace.com/projects/toys">toys</a> - small solutions to specific problems - up to larger undertakings such as the <a href="https://gilesdring.squarespace.com/projects/hebden-rising">Hebden Rising</a> website or the <a href="https://gilesdring.squarespace.com/projects/scrambled-physics">ScrambledPhysics</a> universe simulation library for Processing.</p>
