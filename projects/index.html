<p>
  I'm starting to collect and publish the personal projects that I'm working on
  or have completed. These range in size from <a href="toys">toys</a> - small
  solutions to specific problems - up to larger undertakings such as the
  <a href="hebden-rising">Hebden Rising</a> website or the
  <a href="scrambled-physics">ScrambledPhysics</a> universe simulation
  library for Processing.
