I'm starting something exciting today. I've dabbled with running a few times in
the past, but never really made it part of my daily routine. Completed Couch to 5k,
and then didn't carry on. I didn't go straight back to the couch, but the lack of
a structured programme meant it was much easier to not run than run. It's not just
running: I've trained for and completed long cycling sportives and then having
reached my goal, found that the impetus to keep getting on the bike has dropped off.

A series of odd events occurred over the last week which will hopefully change that.
A [twitter acquaintance](https://twitter.com/CorporateGorila) (we are friends because of
[Mike Watt](http://www.mikewatt.com/), but that's another story) alerted me to the
[Jimmy Watkins review of Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables](https://twitter.com/BiggyTimmkins/status/1277896047554109440?s=20). If you've not seen it, it's worth it.
The [full review is on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuYJe_pt30s).
Anyway I digress. I followed Jimmy, and at some point he tweeted offering training plans.
I idly responded, not expecting anything. I didn't bargain for how enthusiastic he is.
To be honest, the Dead Kennedys review ought to have clued me in.

Long story short, after a twitter DM chat and a couple of emails, I'm now the
proud posessor of a tailored [Running Punks](https://www.runningpunks.com/) training
plan.

Today is day one. A rest day. Ideal!
I thought I'd use the time to reflect on why I'm doing it and how I'll be successful.
My goal here is not to complete the course: it's to get to a point I can get out and run
up the hills for an hour or so. There are fringe benefits: I'll be healthier and lighter
(currently weighing in at 101.9 kg - no, not 102 kg: the 0.1 kg is important). As a 
man approaching 50 in a sedentary job, I'm aware that I need to be more active.

Let's go!
