Over the years I've spent an inordinate amount of time on seemingly useless activity. This has, more often than not, been ultimately useful. Sometimes I beat myself up about this tinkering: it can feel like I'm falling down a hole. That said, recast as continuing professional development (which it definitely could be in many cases), it doesn't look so bad, somehow.
