<p>"Hang on Giles, it is but Thursday. You've got a whole two days left!" Gentle reader, I am one of those fortunate few who have forgone salary for a reduced working week, and as a result, Thursday is the new Friday as far as I am concerned. I've decided to celebrate by working at home, to further progress the thinking on the Proof of Concept.</p>

<p>The day in prospect is relatively clear at present. I have a brief review of a colleague's document and estimates to complete and subsequent related discussion. I have a couple of internal European / Global organisation meetings (which I may treat as optional, given other pressures). Other than that, the day will be spent thinking and documenting.</p>

<p>I've decided to use our internal social collaboration tool (wiki, forum, activity tracking) to manage the information, as I don't have time for the overhead of managing a document set in <em>traditional office tools</em>. My first task will be to rough out and create the appropriate (minimal) structure and then to begin populating it.</p>
