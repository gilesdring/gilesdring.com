<p>
  I'm just returning to work following two months unpaid sabbatical looking
  after our youngest daughter, thanks to the relatively recently introduced
  Additional Paternity Leave. I can honestly say that this is one of the most
  rewarding things I've done (especially having also done the same for our
  first daughter).
</p>

<p>
  Given the inevitable pressures of working life, especially for knowledge
  workers (i.e. those with an almost entirely unstructured working day!)
  I'm going to try to reflect more, and this would seem to be the ideal
  place to do so.

  So far, so good. I've remembered my various passwords (thank you vaguely
  cryptic post-it notes), and am well on the way to downloading the inevitable
  slew of emails. Plan for today is to contact my peers, manager and direct
  reports to check in, and plough into the email to get a sense of what's
  been going on... Wish me luck.
