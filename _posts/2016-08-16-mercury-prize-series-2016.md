In common with previous years (although not for the last couple of years),
I've decided to listen to all the Mercury Prize nominees and write up a brief
review of each.

The [shortlist][NOMS] is below. My aim is write a review per day over the next
week and a bit. I probably won't, but it's good to have aims.

* Anohni - 'Hopelessness'
* Bat For Lashes - 'The Bride'
* David Bowie - 'Blackstar'
* Jamie Woon - 'Making Time'
* Kano - 'Made in the Manor'
* Laura Mvula - 'The Dreaming Room'
* Michael Kiwanuka -  'Love & Hate'
* Radiohead - 'A Moon Shaped Pool'
* Savages - 'Adore Life'
* Skepta - 'Konnichiwa'
* The 1975 - 'I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it'
* The Comet Is Coming - 'Channel the Spirits'
