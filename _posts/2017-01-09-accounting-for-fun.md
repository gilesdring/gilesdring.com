I have spent this evening, as I sometimes do, reconciling bank accounts with credit card statements and categorising household spending. I find this a strangely restful activity.

It's a bit of a mammoth task which I must do periodically to keep track of business expenses. It also keeps me honest about my expenditure. I always promise myself that I shall tackle the task monthly, but I seldom actually get round to it.
