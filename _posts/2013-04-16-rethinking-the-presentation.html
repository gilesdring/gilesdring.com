<p>I was recently reminded of, and re-watched, this presentation by friend and colleague Ian Smith (follow <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/ids">him</a> on twitter, or visit <a target="_blank" href="http://ian-d-smith.me.uk">his homepage</a>). What struck me was</p>
<ol>
<li>how good a presentation it is;<br>
</li>
<li>how bad most of the other presentations I'm subjected to are</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Do me a favour and watch it, internalise it and make better presentations. (I mean, obviously, not you - everyone else...)
