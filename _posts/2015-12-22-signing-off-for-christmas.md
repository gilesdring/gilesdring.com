Yesterday morning I had an epiphany. Well, actually I had a full english
breakfast, but before that I made the decision to dramatically reduce my
use of social media until the new year.

This actually boils down to removing the Facebook and Twitter apps from my
iPhone, as it's become apparent to me that my default holding pattern, given
access to the world's information, literature and opinion, is to dive into
the social media echo chamber and look at videos of cats.

The following blinding revelation occurred to me

1. I'm not all that interesting...
2. ...neither is anyone else. No hard feelings and of course I don't mean
   _you_ personally. This is more of a collective thing.

It's telling that this is the first blog post I've published in well over a
year (on this account, in any case). Naturally I had something to say, so
that helps, but clearing the decks of mindless consumption opens
opportunities.

I was concerned about missing **_@_** mentions on twitter, as I find this
a useful way of making arrangements. Given it's the week before Christmas,
there would be the possibilities of missing out on pints. To deal with this,
I set up an [IFTTT][IFTTT] recipe to alert me.

Furthermore, I still have a need to make myself heard. This actually might
become more important if I manage to reduce my consumption of social media
into the new year, especially as I use the social networks to promote my
business and other activities. I've set up Agile Tortoise [Drafts][DRAFTS]
to compose and send posts. It's a conscious write-only activity which I
tested by sending an update about The Force Awakens. (I heartily enjoyed
it. The film, not the status update.) I understand that this has caused
some comment along the lines of "thought you weren't on Facebook ATM".
I'm not. I've not seen your comments, but thanks for your concern.

I'd not like you to think that I'm some kind of digital ascetic. I'm still
blogging. I'll doubtless end up Instagramming some festive sights, which
will appear on Facebook and Twitter. I'm still playing Neko Atsume. What
I'm not doing is spending time watching the stream of inane social chatter
(again, not _you_). It's too tiring and I need a rest.

This blog post will likely automatically cross post as well. Feel free to
comment there if you like. I'll read it in the new year.
