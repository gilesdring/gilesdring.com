Third run today. Still finding it challenging to run for the full
time, and end up walking a bit. I'm rationalising this by telling
myself that if I end up not enjoying running, I'm less likely to
do it.

It was really great running through the woods - just getting lost.
Definitely need to find some suitable routes near Hebden.

I selected the recent Sauna Youth album 'In Flux' to accompany me.
Love it...

Not a stellar performance, but I enjoyed it!
