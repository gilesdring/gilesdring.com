<p>From time to time I create something useful for a specific purpose. These often find repeated use, and I'm sharing them here in case they are of interest to you. I call these toys, in reference to the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_toy_industry">Birmingham toy trade</a> of the 18th Century.</p>

<p>I came across the <a target="_blank" href="http://davidseah.com/pceo/cal">Compact Calendar</a> by David Seah a few years ago, and found it to be a hugely useful tool for planning. David had published an Excel version of the calendar, along with the nicely designed PDF versions: I just added a few tweaks to this to work the way my brain does. He's continued to develop it, and now has similar functionality, and I recommend you take a look at this as well. In fact, David has a heap of useful tools which help track and manage time, some of which I return to from time-to-time. Do take a look at his site.<br></p>
<p>In the meantime, here's my <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/368534/AutomatedCompactCalendar.XLT">Automated Compact Calendar</a> tool as an Excel template.</p>
