<p>So, here I am at the start of a second week back after paternity leave. Here are a few ruminations on last week, plus some thoughts about the week ahead.</p>

<p>I found it very productive to blog about my working day, on a number of counts.</p>

<ol>
<li>It provided some focus on critical activities</li>
<li>It helped identify patterns in my work: what makes me more (or less) productive, and external factors which I have to accommodate</li>
<li>It acted as a mental warmup</li>
</ol>

<p>It felt at times like I may have edging towards "over-sharing", but the very public nature of the platform also feels important in whatever exchange is happening. It may be that my unseen readership (Hi, everyone!) are acting like some kind of silent review board, raining down praise or approbation on my every shared thought. This in turn, keeps me on my toes and honest. Yes, I'm aware that this is actually just my super-ego talking, but as mentioned, it feels helpful.</p>

<p>I'm definitely going to continue, although I won't bombard my Facebook friends with updates. If you want to keep up to speed with what I'm doing, you'll have to follow me directly on the blog.</p>

<p>The week in prospect holds more of the same. The Proof of Concept, which is a little more documented now, will be progressed. Activities for today are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build infrastructure: database, api layer, etc. This will complement the work I did last night on the front-end framework.</li>
<li>Contact the Business Analyst and Architect on the parent programme and gain their feedback on critical success factors.</li>
<li>Think about how the demo will show these critical success factors.</li>
</ol>
