Ten all-time favorite albums, that really made an impact and is still on your rotation list, even if only now and then. Post the cover. No need to explain (but you can).

## Real to Real Cacophony by Simple Minds

I was a 14-year old Simple Minds ‘stadium era’ fan: Alive and Kicking, that kind of stuff. Then I explored their back catalogue. This was the first ‘Art Music’ I stumbled across. The haunting production still sends the hairs up on the back of my neck. It also taught me to have no preconceptions about the kind of material a band releases.
